# Built-In Types

- Strong static type system
- `!` in functions (eg: `println!`) is a `macro`, which does work before a compilation
- Types include; booleans, chars, integers, decimals, arrays, slices, tuples and functions
- Some types can be inferred, eg: `let x = true` to `let x: bool = true`
- Types can be casted with the `as` keyboard
